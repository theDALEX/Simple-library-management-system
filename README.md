# Simple-library-management-system
Its a simple Java library management system using MySQL for the backend and Java Swing for the frontend. I know Java Swing is old, but it was a great learning project. I made improvements over the reference project, like adding checks for null values using .isEmpty() to ensure data integrity. overall I think its an good starting point.
